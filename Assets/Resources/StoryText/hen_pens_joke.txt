Hen Pen was sniffing a rose when something hit her hat. "My, my!" she said. "The sky is falling. I must tell Wise King." 

She hiked down the path and came upon Duck Luck. "Wake up!" Hen Pen said. With a poke, Duck Luck woke up. 

"The sky is falling," said Hen Pen. "I am going to tell Wise King. Can you come too?" <q(i) Do you think Hen Pen is right about the sky falling? /q><h Take your best guess! Can the sky fall? /h><a no. /a> 

So side by side, Hen Pen and Duck Luck hiked down the path to tell Wise King the sky was falling. They came upon Chick Quick. 

"Wake up! The sky is falling," Hen Pen said. "We are going to see Wise King. Can you come too?" 

So in a line, Hen Pen, Duck Luck, and Chick Quick went to tell Wise King the sky was falling. 

They hiked down the path and came upon Drake Lake. "Wake up!" Hen Pen said. With a poke, Drake Lake woke up. 

"We are going to tell Wise King the sky is falling," they said. "Can you come too?" 

So Hen Pen, Duck Luck, Chick Quick, and Drake Lake went miles to tell Wise King the sky was falling. <q(f) Who were they trying to tell about the sky falling? /q><h Here’s a hint. He’s really wise! /h><a king /a> 

They went down the path and came upon Fox Lox. "Wake up!" Hen Pen said. With a poke, Fox Lox woke up. 

"We are going to tell Wise King the sky is falling," Hen Pen said. "No joke?" said Fox Lox. "Then use the quick path." 

They went down the path to a wide hole. "You will get to Wise King," said Fox Lox. "Come with me." But Hen Pen saw the trick. 

Fox Lox went in. Hen Pen did not. "The joke is on him," Hen Pen said. "My, my! Look at all the nice, ripe apples!" <q(f) Was Fox Lox trying to help Hen Pen, Duck Luck, Chick Quick, and Drake Lake or trick them? /q><h Look at the picture. What is Fox Lox doing? /h><a trick /a>

So Hen Pen, Duck Luck, Chick Quick, and Drake Lake went home to make apple pie. They never did tell Wise King the sky was falling.
