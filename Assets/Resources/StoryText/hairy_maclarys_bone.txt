Down in the town by the butcher’s shop door, sat Hairy Maclary from Donaldson’s Dairy. 

Out of the door came Samuel Stone. He gave Hairy Maclary his tastiest bone. 

Then off up the street on scurrying feet, on his way to the dairy went Hairy Maclary. 

And chasing him home with their eyes on the bone, went Hercules Morse, Bottomley Potts, Muffin McLay, Bitzer Maloney and Schnitzel von Krumm with the very low tum. <q(f) How many dogs are chasing after Hairy Maclary? /q><h Look at the picture. How many dogs are behind Hairy Maclary? /h><a five /a>

Hungrily sniffing and licking their chops, they followed him up past the school and the shops. 

They came to the sign selling Sutherland’s Sauce. Through they all went 

except Hercules Morse. 

They came to a hedge along Waterloo Way. Under they went 

except Muffin McLay. 

They came to a yard full of dinghies and yachts. Round they all went 

except Bottomley Potts. 

They came to a building site, cluttered and stony. Over they went 

except Bitzer Maloney. 

They came to a wall by the house of Miss Plum. One of them jumped 

but not Schnitzel von Krumm. <q(f) Who made it over the wall? /q><h It wasn’t Schnitzel von Krumm! /h><a Hairy Maclary /a>

So at last he was free to go home on his own. Hairy Maclary with ALL of his bone. <q(e) How did Hairy Maclary feel at the end? Can you show me with your face? /q><h Look at the picture. He got to keep the bone all to himself. /h><a positive /a>
