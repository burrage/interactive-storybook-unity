"I found a box," said the fox. "I heard," said the bird. 

"What is that?" said the cat. "We don't know,"  said the crow.

"It is big," said the pig. "Let me see," said the bee. 

"Open it up," said the pup.  "How?" said the cow. "I'll use force," said the horse. 

Ka-boom! <q(f) How did the horse try to open the box? /q> <h Look at his legs. What is the horse doing? /h><a force;strength;kicking;kick /a>

"Use a bat," said the rat. "I will try," said the fly. 

"Good luck," said the duck.  "Beware!" said the hare. 

"Oh no, something green!" <q(i) What was inside the box? /q> <h Who do you think those green skin and white teeth belong to? /h> <a alligator;crocodile /a>

Then the fox and the bird and the cat 

and the crow and the pig and the bee 

and the pup and the cow 

and the horse and the rat and the fly 

and the duck and the hare said, 

"See you later, alligator!"

"Uh-oh" <q(e) How did the alligatior feel when all the animals ran away? /q> <h Look at what alligator is doing in the picture. /h> <a negative;puzzled;confused;funny /a>
