Follow me. I'm going to make clay art. 

First, I draw a sketch. 

Then I roll the clay. 

Next, I shape the clay. 

Sometimes, I add more clay. 

Now I wait for the clay to dry. 

Later, I fire the clay. 

Then I paint the clay. <q(f) What is she doing to the clay now? /q><h Look at the picture. What is she doing? /h><a painting /a> 

Now I can make... 

animals, mobiles, 

music boxes, and necklaces. 

I can even make finger puppets! <q(i) What would you make out of clay? /q><h Look at everything she made out of clay. What would you make? /h><a /a>
