"Wake up, Henry," Papa whispered. "Today is your big day.”

Henry jumped out of bed and <k donned /k> his slippers. He was clearing his throat and started to sing. "Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me..." 

Mama was in the kitchen putting the frosting on Henry's cake using a <k spatula /k>. "Come and see," she called, when she heard him coming down the stairs. "You said I could have chocolate," Henry said when he saw it. <q(l) What is a spatula? /q> <h Hint! It's used when cooking. /h> <a Spatula is what's in Henry's mom's hand. It's used to scoop, mix, or spread things while cooking. For a small robot like me, I can probably use it to row a boat! /a>

"Vanilla will be better," said Mama, and she spread the last bit on the top. "Not everybody likes chocolate." Henry made a face. "I do," he said. "And besides, vanilla will be too plain.” <q(f) What kind of cake did Henry want? /q><h Here’s a hint. Was it vanilla or chocolate? /h><a chocolate /a>

Henry did want his cereal, so he followed Mama into the dining room to set the table. 

A <k bunting /k> was drawn above the dining table. "Uh-oh," Mama said when she counted the candy baskets. "We forgot about cousin Gertie. Be a good boy, Henry, and give her yours. I'll put your candy in a paper cup." <q(l) Do you know what bunting means? /q> <h what's above the dining table? /h> <a Bunting is a decoration like flags. For my birthday, I had a bunting that said "Happy Birthday!" /a>

Henry picked up the shiny, silver-colored basket and moved it slowly over to Gertie's place. "What if you forget?" Henry said. "Don't be silly, Henry. I won't."

When it was time to get dressed, Henry put on his favorite T-shirt and his newest sneakers. He really liked the <k zig-zag /k> lightning shape on his T-shirt. He combed his <k unruly /k> hair and bounded back into the dining room. "I'm ready," he announced. <q(l) What is zig-zag? /q> <h zig-zag zig-zag /h> <a Zig-zag is a line that goes left, right left, right! Like lightning on Henry's shirt! /a>

"No, no," Mama said, and she laughed. "Not today, Henry. Everyone else will be wearing party clothes."

Henry <k donned /k> his white shirt, and Mama tied his bow tie. "There," she said. "Now you are ready." <q(l) Do you know what donned means? /q> <h What's Henry doing in the picture? /h> <a Donned means put on. Look! I donned my red outfit this morning! /a>

"Don’t I look stupid?" he asked sadly. 

The doorbell rang that Henry ran to answer it. It was aunt Sue and cousin Gertie. 

Aunt Sue gave Henry a big birthday kiss that left a sticky red mark on his face.

Gertie gave him a very little package wrapped in paper Henry which thought was ugly, and he knew that it couldn't be anything good. 

Henry's best friend, Mark, brought a big yellowish box, but Henry could tell from the shape that it wasn't the thing Mark had promised. And Timmy forgot his present at home. 

When everyone was there, Papa started the games.

Molly stuck a tail on Henry's back, and Gertie called him a donkey.

The prize for musical chairs was a little silver whistle, and Henry wanted it.

But Timmy pushed him off the last chair just as the music stopped. The room quickly became <k unruly /k> when everyone tried to find a chair. Henry was miserable. "No more games," he said. <q(l) What does unruly mean? /q> <h What happens when no one listens to their teacher? /h> <a Unruly means not in order. Like when no one listens to their teacher and keep shouting and running in a classroom. /a>

So Mama brought in the cake. Everyone sat under the <k bunting /k> and sang "Happy birthday" while aunt Sue lit the candles. "One for each year and one to wish on," she said cheerfully.

Henry had closed his eyes and blew. I wish, he thought, that this were someone else's birthday. And he tried hard not to cry. <q(e) How did Henry feel about his birthday when he blew our the candles? Can you show me with your face? /q><h Look at the picture. How does Henry look? Can you show me with your face? /h><a negative /a>

Then Papa appeared with helium balloons and a special party hat for Henry which looked like a crown. Everybody clapped.

Mama cut the cake with a <k spatula /k> and Henry got the first piece. It was pink and white inside with real whipped cream between the layers. Henry had taken a bite. It was good. "Not too plain?" Mama asked. Henry shook his head.

When Henry opened his presents, he got a kite and a set of paints with a dinosaur coloring book.

Mark really did get him the crocodile raft he had promised - it just had to be blown up. Henry thought the <k zig-zag /k> lines on the crocodile raft were really cool.

Gertie's present was a tiny model fire engine with a siren that really worked, and Henry loved it.

When everyone had gone home, Henry sat on Mama's lap. "Wasn’t it a nice party, after all?" Mama asked. Henry nodded his head. "But I didn't make a very good birthday wish," he said. <q(f) How did Henry feel about his birthday party at the end? /q><h Look at the picture. How does Henry look? /h><a positive /a>

Mama gave him a hug. "Never mind," she said. "You have a whole year to think of another one." Henry smiled. "Ok," he said, "I will."
