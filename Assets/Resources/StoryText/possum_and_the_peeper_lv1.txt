Peep! Peep! Peep! Possum opened one small eye. What was that noise? He buried his head deeper in his warm winter nest.

Peep! Peep! Peep! "I'll never get back to sleep with all the racket," he said. "I will find out who's so inconsiderate, so early in the spring." Possum emerged from his home and stepped out into the cool, green morning. <q(l) What is the meaning of emerge? /q> <h Look! What is Possum doing? /h> <a Emerge means come out or come into view. Possum came out from his house. Possum <k emerged /k> from his house! /a>

Peep! Peep! Peep! Possum looked up. A pair of catbirds built their nest high in a tree among the new leaves. "Is that you there?" demanded Possum. "Not us," said the catbirds. "We can scarcely hear ourselves sing with all that <k clamor /k>." <q(l) Do you know what clamor means? /q><h Why is Possum upset? /h> <a Clamor is a loud noise, like when people shout! A clamor outside my window woke me up this morning. A fire engine was passing by. /a>

"Well, I will go see for myself who's making such an awful din." "We'll come, too." said the catbirds. "We can search high in the trees while you look low on the ground." They set off towards the woods at the <k crest /k> of the hill.

Possum stopped to <k inhale /k> the scent of trout lilies blooming along the path. Peep! Peep! Peep! They followed the noise up a hill.

At the <k crest /k> of the hill stood a bear blinking blearily outside his cave. <q(l) What's a crest of a hill? /q> <h Where is the bear standing? /h> <a Crest means the top of a hill. The bear is standing on the crest of a hill. /a> "Who woke me from my warm winter sleep?" he snarled with his long white teeth. "Was it YOU?" he said, spying Possum. "No," said Possum, "but we are on our way to find out who it was." "I had better come along then," growled the bear. "You may need someone of my size when you find this fellow." <q(f) who slept all winter /q> <h Look at the picture, what do you see? /h> <a bear /a>

They continued over the hill, the catbirds flying overhead, the bear grumbling along behind. The spring sun shone down warm on their feathers and fur. Peep! Peep! Peep! The sound got louder and louder. 

They came down to a marsh where they saw a muskrat spring-cleaning his house. "Excuse us!" shouted Possum. "Have you been the peeper?" "What?" yelled the muskrat. He <k emerged /k> from his house. "I can't hear you over all that noise!" "Well, we're on our way to put a stop to it once and for all," said the bear, "if you could show us the way through this swamp."

They pressed on to follow the muskrat. They peered between the green <k reeds /k> and into dark pools. Closer and closer. Louder and louder.

Possum pushed aside some <k reeds /k>. <q(l) What is a reed? /q> <h What is Possum pushing? /h> <a Reed is a tall plant with long green leaves. It grows near water. One time, my friend made a basket out of reed leaves! /a>

"AH HA!" they cried, squinting at a small spot on the bank. "How could such a speck of a thing make such a huge racket?" asked the bear. "You have woken up the entire forest with all that <k clamor /k>, little frog," said Possum. The little peeper looked up, from the possum to the muskrat to the catbirds and finally to the bear. 

Then he puffed out his tiny throat.  It made him look round and rotund. <q(l) Do you know what rotund means? /q> <h What is the frog doing in the picture? /h> <a Rotund means round. Can you take a deep breath and make your tummy look <k rotund /k>? /a> "Rise and shine!" he shouted. "Shake a leg! Build your nests and clean your burrows! It's spring! It's spring! It's spring!" The bear stepped closer to the little frog. "I," he growled, "don't like to be awakened this early in the year, especially," he added, "by a frog.”

"Oh, but look at the beautiful spring flowers," cried the peeper, "and sniff the good spring smells. I won’t sleep through such a glorious spring day." The animals looked around at the budding trees. They <k inhaled /k> the smell of the blooming flowers and felt the warm sunshine. <q(l) Do you know what inhale means? /q> <h What were the animals doing with the flowers? /h> <a Inhale means to breathe in. Can you try breathing in? That's inhaling! /a> They listened to the buzzing bees and warbling birds. Legs stretched and bellies rumbled. It was quite true. No one could deny that it was a fine thing indeed to be out and about on the first warm day of spring.

"There's nothing quite like a good walk on a spring morning," proclaimed Possum. "Won't you join us for breakfast, little peeper?" But the <k rotund /k> peeper was already peeping again at the top of his lungs. "Time for breakfast! Toast and tea! The early bird gets the worm!" Peep! Peep! Peep! <q(i) how do you think people feel in the spring /q> <h The pepper asks them to "rise and shine and build their nests" /h> <a positive /a>

Peep! Peep! Peep!
