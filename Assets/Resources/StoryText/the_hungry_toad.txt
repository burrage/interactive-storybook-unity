There was once a toad named Toad.

Toad was always hungry. He ate and ate and ate, but he always wanted more.

Like most toads, he could puff out his throat to croak. His throat could get very, very big.

One day Toad ate and ate, but he was still hungry. Then he saw a bar of soap. Gulp! It got stuck in his throat.

So Toad hopped down the road to see the doctor. "A toad does not eat soap," said the doctor as she took it out. <q(f) What did the toad eat? /q><h Look at the picture. What's in toad's hand? /h><a Soap. /a>

The next day Toad ate and ate, but he was still hungry. He saw a toaster. Gulp! It got stuck in his throat.

The doctor said, "Toads do not eat toasters, and toads do not eat soap! I will make a list for you. Don't eat these things again!" <q(f) Why did the toad go to the doctor /q> <h did the toad eat something it wasn't supposed to? /h> <a Toaster stuck in its throat /a>

Do not eat, soap, toasters.

The next day Toad ate and ate, but he was still hungry. He went to the park. Gulp! Toad ate a big foam football!

The doctor was mad. "Give me your list," she said. "I must add something to it!"

The next day Toad ate and ate, but he was still hungry. He met his friend. Gulp! Toad ate her coat.

The doctor was very mad! "What toad eats coats? No one eats coats," she groaned.

The next day Toad ate and ate, but he was still hungry. He looked around. He saw a rowboat. He checked his list.

"A boat is not on my list," he said. "Can I eat a boat?" "Nope, I'd better not."
