This is Rabbit. Do you want to meet him? He lives in a hole in a big tree on the hill. <q(f) Where does rabbit live? /q><h Look at the picture. Is that rabbit's house? Where does he live? /h><a in a hole in a tree; in a tree /a> 

He has lots of weeds to hide in and lots of grass to eat. At the bottom of the hill, there is a little lake where Rabbit gets water. 

One day Rabbit was going down the hill to the lake. The wind was blowing. There was so much dust that Rabbit could not see. 

Rabbit said, "This wind could blow a little rabbit into the lake. I'm glad I'm big so I don't fall in." 

"Caw, caw, caw." Rabbit looked up and saw his friend Crow. Crow liked to play in the wind. It was fun when the wind lifted her up. Rabbit said, "I wish I could fly like my friend Crow." 

The next day there was snow on the top of the big tree. "Caw, caw, caw," Crow said, as she landed on a branch. 

Rabbit was feeling sad. "All I am is a slow rabbit," he said. "I cannot fly like you." <q(e) How does rabbit feel about not being able to fly? Can you show me with your face? /q><h Look at rabbit's face. How does rabbit feel? /h><a negative /a> 

"You don't have wings and you cannot fly," said Crow. "But you can make a little plane to fly." 

"You need some paper and some tape. I'll show you what to do, one step at a time." <q(i) What are they going to make? /q><h Crow said they needed paper. What are they making? /h><a paper airplane; plane; paper plane /a> 

How to Make Crow's Plane: 1. Lay the paper out flat. Fold it down the middle. 2. Fold down one corner. Then fold down the other corner. 

3. Now fold the corners one more time. 4. Then fold one side over the other. 

5. Fold down the wing on one side. Then fold down the wing on the other side. 6. Now open up the wings. Put tape on the top. 

"Caw, caw, caw," said Crow. "Now you are ready to test it."
