Goat liked to sit by an oak tree and read. The book he liked best was "Making and Doing Things." 

Goat liked to make things. He liked to do tricks. The book showed him what to do. 

When Goat wanted to make a boat, he looked on pages 22 and 23 of his book. It said, "How to Make a Boat Out of Soap." 

1. Get some soap. Will it float? Put it in some water to test it. Now go on to the next step. 

2. Find a stick that is three inches long. This will be the mast. A mast helps the boat sail. Put the mast into the soap. 

3. To make a sail, cut some paper, like this. Then use tape to put the sail on the mast. Your boat is ready to float! 

Goat put his boat in the tub. Did it float? No! The boat fell on its side. “My sail is too big,” said Goat. <q(f) Why didn’t Goat’s boat float? /q><h Look at the picture. Why did Goat’s boat fall over? /h><a too big;big sail;sail /a>

So Goat got two cakes of soap and put a rubber band around them. Did the boat float? Yes! 

The next day Goat sat down by the oak tree to read his book. He looked on page 46. It said, "A Neat Trick". 

1. Ask your friends for a crayon. Tell them you can guess what color it is without looking. 

2. Put your hands behind your back. Rub your fingernail with the crayon. This will leave color on your nail. 

3. Say to your friends, "I can feel the color with my hand." Look at your nail, but don’t let them see! 

4. Then tell your friends the color. They will not see the color on your nail or guess what you did. They will say, “What a neat trick!” <q(f) How did Goat know what color the crayon was? /q><h The goat did a little trick with the crayon behind his back. Do you remember what it was? /h><a nail;hand /a>

That’s what Goat’s friends said! Now you can try these things too.
