Donkey and Monkey were friends. They lived by a big lake with a sandy shore. Two trees hid them from the hot sun.

One day Monkey's father came to visit. They all sat in the shade and had some mint tea. Then they went for a walk along the lake.

Monkey's father told some jokes. His jokes were funny. Monkey and Donkey were happy. <q(e) How do Monkey and Donkey feel? Can you show me with your face? /q><h Look at the picture. How do they feel? /h><a positive /a>

All of a sudden, Monkey said, Look! I see a little box in the sand. He ran and picked it up. <q(f) What did Monkey find? /q><h Look a the picture. What is Monkey holding? /h><a box /a>

Donkey said, We need a key. Maybe the key is in the sand. So they all looked for the key. 

I see it, said Monkey's father. He picked up a rusty little key and put it in the keyhole. It unlocked the box.

What was inside? A map! What do you think we will find if we follow it? asked Donkey. <q(f) What was in the box? /q><h Look at the picture. What was in the box? /h><a map /a>

Seek and look, here and there. Follow this map to show you where. Stand in front of the tree. Look at the lake. Then take ten steps.

Now go around the big rock, where you will see two bushes. Go six big steps past them.

Is a low rock wall next to you? Jump up on this wall, but don't fall!

Do you see two paths? Follow the path on the left all the way to the end. 

Now look for a low flat rock. It is between a big and a little tree. Look in the deep grass next to the rock. <q(i) What do you think Donkey and Monkey will find in the grass? /q><h It could be anything! What do you think? /h><a /a>

Donkey and Monkey dashed to the rock. They looked in the tall grass. I see it, said Donkey. It's a jar. It says HONEY!

Monkey's father smiled. Then they all sat down and had some tea and honey.
