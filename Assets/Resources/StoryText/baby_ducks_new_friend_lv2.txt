One sunny afternoon Baby Duck asked his mama if he could go for a swim by himself. "Okay," replied Mama Duck, "but don't forget the rule: Ducklings can't go beyond the old stone bridge unless they are with someone who can fly." "Don't worry," said Baby Duck. "I won't forget."

When Baby Duck reached the old stone bridge, he stopped by the <k arch /k> and sighed. "If only I knew someone who could fly." <q(l) What is an arch? /q> <h What is the shape of the bridge? /h> <a Arch is a curved shape. It supports the weight of a bridge. /a> Just then a small yellow duck <k plummeted /k> from the top of the bridge and landed beside him with a splash! 

It made <k ripples /k> in the water where the yellow duck sat.

"Wow! You fly faster than my mama," cried Baby Duck. "Want to go exploring with me?" the yellow duck bobbled up and down. "Good!" said Baby Duck. "You go first." 

Without saying a word, Baby Duck's new friend turned and floated downstream. <q(i) Where is yellow duck going? /q><h Yellow duck is floating somewhere. Where is it? /h><a downstream; down the river /a>

When the yellow duck spun around, Baby Duck spun around. When it floated backward, Baby Duck floated backward, too. "You don't talk much," said Baby Duck, "but you sure are fun!" 

Soon Baby Duck heard a strange roaring sound. Up ahead was something he had never seen before. "Oh my!" he cried. "The river is broken!"
			
Down, down the two ducks <k plummeted /k>. <q(l) Do you know the meaning of plummet? /q> <h What are the ducks doing in the picture? /h> <a Plummet means fall or drop at high speed. The ducks plummeted because the river was broken! /a> At the bottom of the waterfall, Baby Duck tumbled round and round. 

But the yellow duck just bobbed up to the surface and sailed on. Not a single feather was out of place. 

After a while the river snaked through a dark forest. "This place is scary," said Baby Duck. 

Around the next bend, Baby Duck saw a big fox with an <k auburn /k> colored fur. "Watch out!" he quacked. "Mama said foxes are dangerous!" But the yellow duck just sailed on. <q(e) How does baby duck feel about foxes? /q><h Mama said foxes are scary. How would baby duck feel about foxes? /h><a negative /a>

At the sunset, the river carried the two ducks to the sea.

Now Baby Duck was really frightened. He never dreamed water could be so big. "It's getting late, and I'm hungry," he quacked. "Please take me home." 

Suddenly a giant wave lifted Baby Duck into the air!

When the wave receded, Baby Duck saw a little boy walking down the beach. The boy ran over to the yellow duck and picked it up. 

"I'm going to take you home," he said. Then he put the duck in his bucket and walked away. "Hey, what about me?" cried Baby Duck. "Who's going to take me home?"
									
For a long while, Baby Duck watched the moon rise. <k Corona /k> around the moon was so bright it made Baby Duck’s eyes shiny. <q(l) Do you know what corona is? /q> <h The moon is really bright! What's around the moon? /h> <a Do you see the glow around the moon? That's corona. Sun and stars have corona, too! /a> The waves breaking on the beach looked so big, he was afraid to go back in the water.  

"I never should have followed that yellow duck!" he shouted, and flapped his wings in anger. Suddenly his feet were no longer on the beach. His feet were <k aloft /k> in the air. "Oh my," he thought, "maybe I don't have to swim home after all." <q(i) Why doesn't baby duck have to swim home after all? /q><h Look at baby duck. What is baby duck doing? /h><a he can fly; he's flying; /a>

Baby Duck ran toward the sea. When he reached the water's edge, he flapped his wings and leaped into the air. "Hey, look at me," cried Baby Duck as he rose higher and higher, <k aloft /k> in the night sky, " I'm flying!" <q(l) What's aloft? /q> <h Baby duck is in the air! /h> <a Aloft means up in the air. I wish I could fly aloft! /a>

Baby Duck could see the river glistening in the moonlight. "That's the way home," he quacked. He followed the river through the forest, past the waterfall, all the way back to the old stone bridge. The <k corona /k> around the moon was still shining brightly.

Finally he landed in the river with a splash that made <k ripples /k> in the water. He paddled the rest of the way home. <q(l) What's a ripple? /q> <h Look around where Baby duck landed, around the splash. What do you see? /h> <a Ripples are small waves. Like those circles in the water where the duck landed. Try creating ripples at bath time! /a>

Baby Duck reached the <k arch /k> of the old stone bridge. 

As Baby Duck neared the nest, he quacked, "Mama, I'm home!" Mama Duck was overjoyed to see her baby. Then she scowled. "Where have you been?" "I swam all the way to the sea," replied Baby Duck.

"Did you break the rule?" asked his mama. "Oh no," said Baby Duck. "I was with my new friend. He didn’t have <k auburn /k> feathers like us! He was yellow!” “Sounds like it was fun," said Mama Duck, and gave Baby Duck a minnow for his dinner. <q(l) What is the meaning of auburn? /q> <h What color are Baby ducks' feathers? /h> <a When you mix red with brown, that's an auburn color! I have a friend who has an auburn hair. /a>

"Now settle down and get some rest," said Mama Duck. "Tomorrow is going to be a big day." "What's so special about tomorrow?" asked Baby Duck. "Well," quacked Mama Duck softly. "Tomorrow I'm going to teach you how to fly!" <q(i) Why is Mama Duck trying to teach Baby Duck to fly? /q> <h Has Mama Duck ever seen Baby Duck fly? /h><a can't fly;doesn't know /a>
