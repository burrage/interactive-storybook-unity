It is cool and sunny on this autumn afternoon. The smell of sweet fern is everywhere. "William, do you want to go for a walk?" asks Cammy. "Sure," says William. "Let's go."

The children follow a well-worn path into the woods. They walk under an old cherry tree. They see an empty nest. Who's been here? <q(i) Who do you think they will find in the nest? /q><h What animal is usually in a nest? /h><a bird;eggs;birds /a>

A northern oriole.

Cammy and William come to a big rock. A tree had split it apart, and a flat stone juts out of the tree. Who's been here?

A red squirrel.

The trail follows an old stone wall. The children and their dog, Sam, climb over it. A clump of milkweed plants grows in the field on the other side. Something hangs from a milkweed leaf. Who's been here?

A monarch butterfly. <q(f) What kind of butterfly did they find?/q><h Here’s a hint. It starts with the letter M. /h><a monarch /a>

Cammy and William climb over a smooth gray tree that has fallen across the trail. The bark has been gnawed off the branches close to the ground. Who's been here?

A snowshoe hare.

Cammy finds a blue feather on the trail. Then she finds another one on a leaf and five more under a laurel bush. Who's been here?

A goshawk and a blue jay.

Gray rock breaks up the leaf-covered hillside. Something black catches the children's eyes. It is a small, dark cave. Sam runs ahead and barks at the opening. William stops and grabs his sister's hand. There are bleached bones on the ledge outside the cave. Who's been here? <q(f) Do you remember the dog’s name? /q><h Here’s a hint. It starts with the letter S. /h><a Sam /a>

A family of red foxes and a woodchuck.

William and Cammy stop beside a large gray boulder. Something strange is stuck to the rock. Who's been here?

A mud dauber.

An orange wood lily stands in a sunny clearing. The flower is almost as tall as Cammy. There is another stalk next to it. But the flower is gone. Who's been here?

A deer.

Cammy and William follow the path on their way home. The rich smell of sweet fern fills the air again. They find a basket on a blanket under an old apple tree. "I wonder who's been here?" William asks. But Cammy knows...

Daddy.
