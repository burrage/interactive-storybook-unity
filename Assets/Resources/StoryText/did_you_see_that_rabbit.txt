Rabbits are fast. They can hop, hop, hop. 

Did you see that rabbit? Where did he go? <q(f) Where is the rabbit? /q><h Look at the picture. Where is the rabbit? /h><a under the bush; in the plant /a> 

Rabbits like plants. 

They rip the tops. Their teeth nip and chop. 

Rabbits dig holes. 

This rabbit hid his hole. He drops plants on top. 

What is down in the hole? Rabbit kits! A rabbit can have lots of kits. <q(l) What is a kit? /q><h Look at the picture. What are rabbit kits? /h><a Kit is a baby rabbit! /a> 

This kit sips milk. That kit hops and flops. The rabbit and kits nap. 

Rabbits have to look out for the kits. Do you see the rabbit up on the hill? She stops and sits still. She sniffs. 

The rabbit and kits come down--fast! <q(i) What is chasing the rabbits? /q><h Look at the picture. What is in the sky? /h><a owl; bird /a> 

You can see rabbits out there. You can see rabbits in here. 

This rabbit will plop down on your lap. You can pet him. 

Did you see that rabbit? He likes you!
