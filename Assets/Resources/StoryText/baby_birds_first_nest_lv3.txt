Once upon a time, there lived a baby bird with her mom. Baby bird had a <k mauve /k> colored feather. One night baby bird rolled over in her sleep, tumbled out of her nest, and woke up with a thump. Baby bird laid <k prostrate /k> on the ground. <q(l) What is prostrate? /q> <h Look at what the bird is doing. She's lying on her tummy! /h> <a prostrate means lying with your face down. I actually can't lie prostrate because I'm round. /a>

Baby bird wasn't hurt, but she was very frightened. She sat on the grass <k tufts /k>. Because darkness loomed all around her even the moon looked cold and scary. 

"Mama, help me!" she cried. But mama bird was fast asleep in a deep <k slumber /k>. <q(l) What is slumber? /q> <h what is the mama bird doing? /h> <a slumber means sleep. I like to take a short slumber after lunch. /a>

Beneath baby bird's tree lived little frog. "What are you croaking about?" he asked. "I just fell out of my nest," baby bird said, flapping her tiny wings, "and I can't get back." <q(f) Who did baby bird just meet? /q><h Look at the picture. Who is baby bird talking to? /h><a little frog; frog /a>

Little frog climbed out of his pond. "I was going for a moonlight swim. Do you want to come along?" "I just want to go back to my mama and my nest!" sniffled baby bird. "Don't worry, your mama will find you in the morning," said little frog. "The morning's a long way off," replied baby bird. "What shall I do till then?" " You can’t build your own nest?" asked little frog. "I've never built a nest before," sighed baby bird. "Neither have I," said little frog. "But I'd be glad to help you." 

So baby bird and little frog set to work building a nest. They gathered twigs and pine needles to make the outside. Then they lined the inside with birch bark and deer grass. The nest was a <k montage /k> of many different materials. <q(l) What is montage? /q> <h how is the nest made? /h> <a montage is making something with different materials. I'm a montage of plastic, metal, and fabric! /a>

The nest was built on top of the grass <k tufts /k>. <q(l) What is tuft? /q> <h the nest was built on grass tufts. /h> <a Tuft is a group of things like grass or hair. See my beads on my head? Those are tufts of fur. /a> When the nest was finished, baby bird hopped inside and chirped, "It's beautiful! And cozy, too!" With a skip and a jump, little frog flipped himself into the nest. 

"Kind of scratchy for my taste," he croaked. "Of course you'd think that. You're a frog," said baby bird. "But it's perfect for me." Then she sighed with relief. "My very first nest." <q(e) How does baby bird feel about her first nest? Can you show me with your face? /q><h Baby bird just built her first nest. How do you think she feels? /h><a positive /a>

Once the baby bird snuggled down it soon began to feel sleepy. But little frog sat up straight. "I hear paws," he croaked. 

"Quick, follow me!" Little frog leaped out of the nest and <k dove /k> into the pond. Kerplunk! <q(l) What is dove? /q> <h what is the frog doing? /h><a dove is past of dive. Diving is going head first into water. My rubber duck dove in the bath tub when I was taking a bath! /a>

Baby bird almost looked up and saw a hungry raccoon. 

"If I jump in the pond, I'll drown," she thought. So she scrambled out of her nest and fled in the opposite direction. 

Baby bird next spied a low branch above her head. She crouched down, flapped her tiny wings, and hopped up onto the branch. 

Raccoon stood on his <k hind /k> legs. Baby bird closed her eyes, trembling with fear. But raccoon couldn't reach her. <q(l) What is hind? /q> <h Raccoon is standing on its hind legs. Those are his back legs. /h> <a Hind means back! I have a horse friend who likes to kick with its hind legs! /a>

Raccoon hunted in the water until he found a fish to eat. Little frog hid himself and laid <k prostrate /k> inside the water. 

When raccoon was gone, little frog swam ashore and went looking for baby bird. He looked in the nest. It was empty. He looked behind the nest and even under the nest. "Oh my," he croaked. "Raccoon got baby bird!"

"No, he didn't. I'm up here." Little frog glanced up and found baby bird <k perched /k> on the branch. <q(l) What is perched? /q> <h what is the bird doing? /h><a perching is resting or sitting on something. I'm perching on a table /a> "How did you get up there?" asked little frog. "I hopped up," replied baby bird. 

"If you can hop up there, you can hop back to your nest," said little frog. "I can't hop that far!" gasped baby bird. <q(i) Do you think baby bird can get back to her nest? /q><h Little frog thinks she can hop up. What do you think? /h><a yes; she can /a>

"Sure you can," said little frog, "if you take it one hop at a time. Here, I'll show you." 

Using his strong <k hind /k> legs, little frog hopped to baby bird's perch. "Now follow me," he said, and hopped to a branch above her head. " You won’t do that?" "Sure," chirped baby bird. "Good," said little frog, and he hopped to the next higher branch. 

Little frog hopped, and baby bird followed more higher and higher, all the way back to her nest. "Mama, I'm home," she cried as she <k perched /k> on the branch next to her nest. Slowly mama bird opened her eyes. "Of course you are, my darling," she said with a yawn. "But what are you doing out there?" 

Mama bird lifted baby bird into the nest with her <k mauve /k> wings. They were the same color as the baby bird’s. "Mama," cried baby bird, "I've had the most wonderful adventure! I built my very first nest using a <k montage /k> of many materials." "Yes, yes." Mama bird yawned again. "You can tell me all about it in the morning." Soon mama bird went back to sleep in a deep <k slumber /k>. <q(l) What color is mauve? /q> <h Both baby bird and her mom have mauve feathers /h><a Mauve is a purplish color. I wish I had a mauve colored outfit. /a>

"Your mama's nice," said little frog. "You don’t want to sleep in our nest tonight?" asked baby bird. <q(i) Do you think little frog will sleep in the nest? /q><h What did little frog think of baby bird's nest on the ground? Did he like it? /h><a no /a>

Little frog thought for a moment. "Too scratchy," he replied. "So what are you going to do now?" asked baby bird. "I guess I'll finish that moonlight swim," said little frog. "Get ready for the highest dive you ever saw!" 

"Thanks, I had fun," said baby bird. "Me, too," said little frog. "Will I ever see you again?" asked baby bird. "I certainly hope so!" croaked little frog. And he <k dove /k> into the night.
