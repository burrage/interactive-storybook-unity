I see the tot. 

Stop, tot, stop! 

Is the tot in the pot? 

Yes, I see the tot. The tot is in the pot. 

Oh, no! The pot is on the tot. Pop, stop the tot! 

He stops the tot. <q(f) Who stops the tot? /q> <h Look at the picture, whom do you see? /h> <a pop /a>

See the tot. She is on top of me. Mom, stop the tot! 

She stops the tot. 

I see the tot. I see a dot on the tot. 

I see a lot of dots on the tot.  <q(i) What do you think tot will do next? /q> <h Why is tot looking at her sister? /h> <a sister face; her face  /a>

The tot likes dots. I do not. No, no, tot. No dots on me! Pop, stop the tot!  

He stops the tot. 

I am mad. The tot is sad. She is sad and I am sad.  

I like you, tot. I am not mad.
