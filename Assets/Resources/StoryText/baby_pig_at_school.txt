Danny had a baby pig who liked to be with him. Danny asked to bring the pig to school for show and tell. 

Danny's mom said, "OK." His dad said, "OK." His teacher said, "OK." His sister said, "That's silly." 

Danny was happy that the baby pig could come to school. He had a wagon to put the pig in. <q(f) What is Danny putting his pig in? /q><h Danny is putting his pig in something. Where is he putting pig? /h><a wagon /a> 

Danny's mom said, "Here is a fluffy cloth for the pig to sit on." His dad said, "Here is Pig's lunch." His sister said, "All this for a pig?" 

At school all twenty children got out of their seats to see the baby pig. The teacher told them to pet him very softly. 

A boy said, "He's pretty cute." A girl said, "He's funny." The teacher said, "It's time to study. Now get your books." 

Danny sat with his baby pig. They quickly got to work. They liked to read. 

A girl said, "That is a good book for a pig." A boy said, "A pig can't read." Danny said, "Yes, my pig can." 

It was time for art. The children put their handprints on paper with paint. 

A boy said, "My hands are red!" A girl said, "This is fun!" The class said, "Pig can paint!" 

After art, the children were ready to eat lunch. <q(i) What is the class doing next? /q><h They look hungry. What will they do next? /h><a eat; have lunch /a> They quickly took their seats and sat and ate. 

Then a boy said, "Let's play." A girl said, "Oh! This is messy!" The pig looked at the trash can. 

The pig picked up a paper bag and put it in the trash can. Then all the children did it too. 

Danny said to his classmates, "I told you my pig can read!" The teacher said, "Come back to see us any day, Baby Pig!" <q(e) How does Danny feel about bringing his pig to school? Can you show me with your face? /q><h Look at Danny's face. How does he feel? /h><a positive /a>
