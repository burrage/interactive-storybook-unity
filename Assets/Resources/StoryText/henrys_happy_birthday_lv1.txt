"Wake up, Henry,” said Papa. "Today is your big day." 

Henry flew out of bed and <k donned /k> his slippers. He would clear this throat then start to sing. "Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me..." 

Mama was in the kitchen putting the frosting on Henry's cake with a <k spatula /k>. "Come see," she said, when she heard him coming down the stairs. "You said I could have chocolate," Henry said when he saw it. <q(l) What is a spatula? /q> <h Hint! It's used when cooking. /h> <a Spatula is what's in Henry's mom's hand. It's used to scoop, mix, or spread things while cooking. For a small robot like me, I can probably use it to row a boat! /a>

"Vanilla will be better," said Mam as she spread the last bit on the top. "Not everybody likes chocolate." Henry made a face. "I do," he said. "Besides, vanilla will be plain." <q(f) What kind of cake did Henry want? /q><h Here’s a hint. Was it vanilla or chocolate? /h><a chocolate /a>

Henry didn't want his cereal, so he couldn’t follow Mama into the dining room to set the table.

Henry saw a <k bunting /k> above the dining table. "Uh-oh," Mama said when she had taken count of the candy baskets. "We forgot about cousin Gertie. Be a good boy, Henry, please give her yours. I'll put your candy in a paper cup." <q(l) Do you know what bunting means? /q> <h what's above the dining table? /h> <a Bunting is a decoration like flags. For my birthday, I had a bunting that said "Happy Birthday!" /a>

Henry would pick up the shiny, silver-colored basket. He would move it slowly over to Gertie's place. "Don’t forget" Henry said. "Don't be silly, Henry. I won't."

When it was time to get dressed, Henry put on his favorite <k zig-zag /k> T-shirt and sneakers. He did not comb his <k unruly /k> hair as he ran back into the dining room. "I'm ready," he would announce. <q(l) What is zig-zag? /q> <h zig-zag zig-zag /h> <a Zig-zag is a line that goes left, right left, right! Like lightning on Henry's shirt! /a>

"No, no," Mama said. "Not today, Henry. Everyone else will be wearing party clothes."

Henry <k donned /k> his white shirt. Mama would tie his bow tie. "There," she said. "Now you are ready." <q(l) Do you know what donned means? /q> <h What's Henry doing in the picture? /h> <a Donned means put on. Look! I donned my red outfit this morning! /a>

"I look stupid," he said sadly.

The doorbell rang. Henry ran to answer it. It was aunt Sue with cousin Gertie.

Aunt Sue gave Henry a big birthday kiss that left a sticky red mark on his face.

Gertie gave him a package in wrapping paper Henry thought was ugly. He knew it couldn't be anything good. 

Henry's best friend, Mark, brought a big yellow box, but Henry could tell from the shape that it wasn't the thing Mark had said. Timmy forgot his present at home.

When everyone was there, could Papa start the games.

Molly stuck a tail on Henry's back. Gertie would call him a donkey.

The prize for musical chairs was a little silver whistle which Henry would have chosen.

But Timmy would push him off the last chair just as the music would stop. The room quickly became <k unruly /k>. Everyone tried to find a chair. Henry was miserable. "No more games," he said. <q(l) What does unruly mean? /q> <h What happens when no one listens to their teacher? /h> <a Unruly means not in order. Like when no one listens to their teacher and keep shouting and running in a classroom. /a>

So Mama brought in the cake. Everyone sat under the <k bunting /k> and sang "Happy birthday" as aunt Sue lit the candles. "One for each year plus one to wish on," she said cheerfully.

Henry could close his eyes to blow the candles. I wish, he thought, that this were someone else's birthday. Then he could try hard not to cry. <q(e) How did Henry feel about his birthday when he blew our the candles? Can you show me with your face? /q><h Look at the picture. How does Henry look? Can you show me with your face? /h><a negative /a>

Papa came with helium balloons. He had a special party hat for Henry that was like a crown. Everybody would clap.

Mama cut the cake with a <k spatula /k>. Henry got the first piece. It was pink and white inside with real whipped cream between the layers. Henry took a bite. It was good. "Not too plain?" Mama would ask. Henry shook his head.

When Henry could open his presents, he got a kite as well as a set of paints with a dinosaur coloring book.

Mark really did get him the crocodile raft - it just had to be blown up. The crocodile raft had <k zig-zag /k> lines.

Gertie's present was a tiny model fire engine with a siren that really drove. Henry was fond of it.

When everyone had gone home, Henry sat on Mama's lap. "Nice party, after all?" Mama asked. Henry shook his head. "But I didn't make a good birthday wish," he said. <q(f) How did Henry feel about his birthday party at the end? /q><h Look at the picture. How does Henry look? /h><a positive /a>

Mama gave him a hug. "Never mind," she said. "You have a whole year to think of another one." Henry would smile. "Ok," he said, "I will."
