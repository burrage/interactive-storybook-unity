This book is about small animals that have BIG names. Some jump. Some crawl. Some swim in the sea. You can read their names if you do it just a little bit at a time. 

ar-ma-dil-lo. Some armadillos are six inches long. They have skin that feels like a bone. They have small legs but they are fast. The armadillo raced to the tree. Go, armadillo, go! <q(l) Can you pronounce armadillo? /q> <h ar-ma-dil-lo /h> <a Armadillo! /a>

sal-a-man-der. Salamanders live in tree trunks, in caves, or under rocks. They eat slugs, snails, and other small animals. The spotted salamander chased the bug. 

grass-hop-per. Some grasshoppers can grow to be five inches long. The baby ones don't have wings. All grasshoppers can hop! The grasshopper jumped on the leaf. Can you find it? 

hum-ming-bird. Hummingbirds are the smallest birds. Some are less than three inches long. Hummingbird wings flap so fast they "hum." The hummingbird sipped from the flower with its long bill. <q(i) Why is hummingbird called hummingbird? /q> <h What sound does it make when flapping? /h><a hum;hums;flap;flaps;wing;wings /a>

an-cho-vy. An anchovy is a small fish with lots of bones. Anchovies swim around in schools. They are very fast. The school of anchovies flashed by in the water. 

zy-zo-mys. This is a funny word to spell and say. A zyzomys is a little rat. Sometimes it is called a rock rat. The zyzomi looked for food. 

ape. What is this? This is not a small animal! We will save it for a new book. What will that book be named?
