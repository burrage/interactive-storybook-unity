My pop had a red car. The red car did not go. "Oh, no!" said Pop. <q(f) Why is Pop sad? /q><h Look at Pop. What's wrong? /h><a car won't start; car won't go; car broken; /a> 

I said, "Stop, Clifford." I said, "Drop, Clifford. Help my pop." 

I said, "Hop on, Pop." My pop was up, up, up! 

Clifford ran and ran. He ran with Pop on top. 

Pop got to the shop where Mom was. 

Clifford ran home to me with Mom and Pop. <q(f) Who did Clifford bring back from the shop? /q><h Look at the picture. Who is on Clifford? /h><a mom and pop; mom /a> 

I said, "Drop, Clifford. Come down, Mom. Come down, Pop." 

Clifford is tops!
