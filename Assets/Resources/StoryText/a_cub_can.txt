It can do a lot. <q(i) What do you think a cub can do? /q><h What do other animals do? Could a cub do those things? /h><a run; jump; play; sit; hop; sleep; sit; eat /a> 

It can sit in a lap. It can nap. 

It can sip. It can nip! 

It can play a lot. But it cannot be hot. <q(f) How is the cub staying cool? /q><h The cub can't be hot, so it put its face on something. What is it? /h><a ice /a> 

It can dip. It can flip. 

It can hop. It can plop. 

It can flop! 

It can run. It can have fun. 

With help, a cub can grow up.
